"""Corrections are identified as pre-processing routines which alter the data without
modifying the metadata. These are based on the central class ``BaseCorrection``, which
provides workflow, independent of the image type. Corrections are typical routines to
be used as transformations when defining an image, see :mod:`darsia.image`.
