The presets in this folder contain standardized setups
useful for general image analyses of co2 experiments
in two-dimensional physical assets. A prominent example
are the FluidFlower experiments, providing here also
the name (only chosen due to historical reasons).

The setups are e.g. heavily used in the image analysis
of the FluidFlower International Benchmark Dataset.
