"""Measuring of physical quantities in porous media is performed by integration over the
domain. Thus, knowledge over physical information is required, as depth (for 2d images)
and porosity. Several special cases are features for convenience. In addition,
this subpackage holds tools to measure differences between images by considering
the Earth mover's distance.
