"""Multi-image comparison tools to track dynamics in static images. Such are employed
in order to study concentration analyses, local deformations (equivalent with the task
of image regstration). An important step of translating iages to concentrations is the
signal transformation into physically meaningful data. This can be achieved through
scaling etc. Tools to calibrate models of interest are provided in this subpackage.
