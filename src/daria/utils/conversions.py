    The standard ordering of pixels for images is that the top left
    corner is the (0,0) pixel. With increasing x- and y-pixels, one
    moves towards the lower right corner. In addition, the first and
    second components correspond to the y and x pixels, respectively.
    This is inconsistent with the physical coordinate system,
    considering a standard photograph.

    Therefore, we introduce the term 'physical ordering' which identifies
    the lower left corner as (0,0) pixel. And with increasing x-
    and y-pixels, one moves towards the top right corner. In addition,
    first and second components correspond to x and y.
