This directory contains several examples on how DarSIA can be used to
analyze images of the FluidFlower. The run scripts demonstrate the practical
use of darsia, while in addition, notebooks include Jupter notebooks
which instead have a more introductory character.

Topics covered in the examples are:
* color and curvature correction
* tracer and co2 detection
* compaction analysis
* sand layer segmentation
