    "The color correction maps the colorspace of the image to fit with the one of a classic color checker (Only usable if a color checker is present in the image). Drift correction is useful when a series of images is analyzed. Currently, it works by translating an image so that the color checkers overlap between images. Curvature/shape correction corrects for geometrically distorted features in the image by removing curvature (obtaining a 2D representation of the object of interest in the image), and cropping the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corrections can all be steered from config files, and in this notebook, the setup of it is demonstrated. First the color correction and drift correction is initialized on a base image, by defining the location of the color checker. Then, a 5-step procedure for setting up curvature correction of an image is performed. Finally, an example of how load the information related to the correction procedure is performed.\n",
