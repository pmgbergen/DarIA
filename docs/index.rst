DarSIA
======

DarSIA, short for Darcy Scale Image Analysis Toolbox, is a research code aiming at quantitative image analysis for images of porous media applications. The Darcy scale is of particular interest, and thus physics upscaling lies at the heart of DarSIA.

The supported image data types include optical images (png, jpg, tif, ...), DICOM images, and simulation data (vtk, ... - anything that meshio can read). Preprocessing routines to transform and align images as well as routines for extracting physical information from images (e.g., concentrations) are provided.
