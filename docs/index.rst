DarSIA
======

DarSIA, short for Darcy Scale Image Analysis, is a research code aiming at quantitative image analysis for images of porous media applications. It provides a collection of algorithms and basic workflows for phyisical image processing. The Darcy scale is of particular interest, and thus physics upscaling lies at the heart of DarSIA.

Various image data types are supported, including optical images (png, jpg, tif, ...), DICOM images, and simulation data (vtk, and essentially any format readable by meshio). Preprocessing routines to transform and align images as well as routines for extracting physical information from images (e.g., concentrations) are provided.
